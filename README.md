## Notes HW1:
Shape is an abstract class for different kinds of shapes like Circle, Square, Triangle. It takes the central coordinates - (x,y), and perimeter of the shape, as parameters.

3 different subclasses have been inherited - Circle, Square and Triangle and each calculate their own perimeter, and override the display function.

ShapeDatabase instantiates new shapes and stores them in a collection. It also provides utility functions to display each shape, *sort them by perimeter*.

ShapeTest contains the main method. It instantiates a database object and calls the utility functions of ShapeDatabase. Run ShapeTest to test the program.

## Notes HW2:
Please use Python 3.6 to compile.
Changes to the existing code have been mentioned in the comments on top.
